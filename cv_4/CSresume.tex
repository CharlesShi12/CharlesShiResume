\end{small}
\vspace{.5mm}
\textbf{Futurist Academy} — {\sl Software Developer Intern} \hfill July 2020 - September 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm]
\item Created a similarity search algorithm called MedSearch that takes in the abstract of any research paper and outputs similar COVID-19 research papers to advance COVID-19 research.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6.4mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
\item[$\circ$] Utilized Natural Language Processing to extract keywords from over \textbf{125,000} COVID-19 research papers.
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Stored each paper's ID and keywords in a TigerGraph graph database (stored over \textbf{350,000} nodes \& \textbf{1,000,000} edges).
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Wrote GSQL queries that found the most similar COVID-19 research papers using the Jaccard similarity index.
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Built and used a RESTful API for MedSearch's backend to safely interact with TigerGraph and enhance overall security.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm]
\item Developed a personalized patient dashboard that gives doctors and researchers an in-depth analysis of synthetic patient data through informative visualizations and statistics.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6.95mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
\item[$\circ$] Obtained Synthea-generated patient data and computed patient statistics by writing multiple GSQL queries in TigerGraph.
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Programmed the patient dashboard and data visualizations using Dash and Plotly in Python.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\textbf{STEM Builders} — {\sl Computer Science and Robotics Teacher} \hfill September 2018 - Present\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm] \itemsep -2pt 
\item Taught programming languages (Python, Java, HTML/CSS, MIT App Inventor, Scratch) and robotics to \textbf{K-8} students. 
\vspace{1mm}
\item Successfully mentored more than \textbf{75} students and gained leadership experience after adapting to unforeseen circumstances. 
\vspace{1mm}
\item Designed/planned final projects that assessed the students' problem solving skills while incorporating their interests.
\end{itemize}

\section{PROJECTS}
\end{small} 
\vspace{.5mm}
\href{https://github.com/CharlesShi12/CalcShare}{\textbf{CalcShare}} — {\sl JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Kotlin, Javalin, WebSockets, APIs} \hfill August 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm] \itemsep -2pt 
\item Constructed an interactive web-based calculator that allows real-time collaboration between users. 
\vspace{1mm}
\item Utilized Kotlin to design a server with unique IDs for each room and data structures that store each room's collaborators and their previous and current calculations.
\vspace{1mm}
\item Developed a JavaScript client to communicate with the server, implemented WebSockets to handle the constant influx of data, and interacted with a RESTful API to compute equations inputted by the user. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\href{https://github.com/CharlesShi12/AI_Tumor_Scanner}{\textbf{Tumor Scanner}} — {\sl Python, OS Module, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, Neural Network}\hfill July 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm] \itemsep -2pt 
\item Collaborated with a team of three other developers to create a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying tumors from brain MRI scans.
\vspace{1mm}
\item Built the neural network with TensorFlow/Keras and used data augmentation to train it with more than \textbf{7,000} images.
\vspace{1mm}
\item Tested and modified the neural network to obtain a final average accuracy of \textbf{95\%}. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\href{https://github.com/CharlesShi12/GibberishGenerator}{\textbf{Gibberish Generator}} — {\sl Java, Trie Data Structure, Conditional Probability} \hfill May 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm] \itemsep -2pt 
\item Programmed an algorithm in Java that generates random English-like words using models and optimized data structures. 
\vspace{1mm}
\item Trained the models with over \textbf{80,000} English words to produce accurate/pronounceable outputs and designed a Trie data structure for efficiency.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\href{https://github.com/CharlesShi12/ImageFilters}{\textbf{Image Filtering System}} — {\sl Python, Machine Learning, PPM Image Formatting} \hfill March 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm] \itemsep -2pt 
\item Implemented a Python program that uses unsupervised machine learning to filter/reduce an image down to however many core colors its users select.
\vspace{1mm}
\item Applied PPM raster image formatting and constructed a k-means clustering algorithm to find the dominant colors of an inputted image and filter/reduce the image based on those colors. 
\end{itemize}
