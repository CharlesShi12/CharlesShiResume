\textbf{Futurist Academy} — {\sl Software Developer Intern} \hfill July 2020 - September 2020\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm]
\item Created a similarity search algorithm called MedSearch that takes in the abstract of any research paper and outputs similar COVID-19 research papers to advance COVID-19 research.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6.4mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
\item[$\circ$] Extracted keywords from more than \textbf{125,000} COVID-19 research papers using Natural Language Processing.
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Wrote GSQL queries that found similar COVID-19 research papers by calculating the Jaccard similarity index.
\vspace{1mm}
\item[$\circ$] Built and used a RESTful API for MedSearch's backend to safely interact with TigerGraph and enhance overall security.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.25mm]
\item Developed a personalized patient dashboard that gives doctors and researchers an in-depth analysis of synthetic patient data through informative visualizations and statistics.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-6.95mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
\item[$\circ$] Obtained Synthea-generated patient data and computed patient statistics by writing multiple GSQL queries in TigerGraph.
